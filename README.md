## My process
 Using HTML, CSS and JS Learnings, I start implementing UI design from the outer most main components like container and section then putting all the sub-components, and then comes the most interesting part you might have guessed, it is called CSS Styling.
off course, it backs life in it, colors, images and design was given already so it became easy to full fill it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
